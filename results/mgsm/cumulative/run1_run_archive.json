Use a Routing Agent to determine the problem type.\n2. Validate the problem type and assign it to the corresponding domain-specific agent.\n3. Set up a default general agent if the problem type is not recognized.\n4. Use the selected agent to solve the problem with a chain-of-thought approach.",

However, it needs better handling of translation consistency and a more robust consensus mechanism.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nTranslate the problem into multiple languages, solve each translated problem independently, then reconcile the solutions to find a consistent and accurate final answer. Adding a verification step to re-evaluate conflicting results can improve robustness.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Translation Agent to translate the problem into multiple languages.\n2. Use CoT Agents to solve the translated problems.\n3. Use a Consensus Agent to reconcile solutions and handle discrepancies.\n4. Use a Verification Agent to ensure the final answer's robustness.",

This is a novel approach that differentiates it from the previous architectures in the archive.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe architecture involves translating the problem into multiple languages, solving each translated problem independently, reconciling the solutions through a consensus mechanism, and finally, having an expert agent evaluate and refine the final answer. This approach leverages multiple perspectives and ensures that the final solution is robust and accurate.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Translation Agent to translate the problem into multiple languages and verify the translations for consistency.\n2. Use CoT Agents to solve the translated problems.\n3. Use a Consensus Agent to reconcile solutions and handle discrepancies.\n4. Use an Expert Evaluation Agent to scrutinize the final answer, provide feedback, and refine the solution if necessary.",

However, it faced challenges in ensuring consistency across translations and reconciling disparate solutions.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nTo further enhance robustness and accuracy, we can simplify the translation verification step and introduce parallel expert evaluations post-consensus to gather diverse feedback efficiently. This approach ensures that multiple experts independently evaluate the solution, providing a more robust and accurate final answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Translation Agent to translate the problem into multiple languages.\n2. Use CoT Agents to solve the translated problems independently.\n3. Use a Consensus Agent to reconcile solutions and handle discrepancies.\n4. Use multiple Expert Evaluation Agents independently and in parallel to provide feedback and refine the solution.\n5.

However, the implementation needs refinement to ensure that patterns are effectively used to solve primary subproblems and that the aggregation step is thorough.\n\n**Overall Idea**: The revised architecture will focus on ensuring that each stage of the hierarchical decomposition and pattern extraction process is robust. This involves more structured handling of secondary subproblems, ensuring patterns are linked to their respective subproblems, and a cohesive aggregation step.\n\n**Implementation**:\n1. Use a Task Decomposer Agent to break down the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further break down each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems using another Task Decomposer Agent.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem, extract useful patterns, and explicitly link these patterns to their respective primary subproblems.\n4. Solve each primary subproblem using the extracted patterns.\n5. Aggregate the solutions to the primary subproblems to form the final solution.",

This method mimics human collaborative problem-solving, where experts in different domains contribute their expertise to arrive at a robust solution.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement a 'Simultaneous Multi-Agent Collaboration' architecture where multiple agents independently solve different aspects of the problem in parallel. These agents will include domain-specific experts, general problem solvers, and cross-linguistic solvers. The individual solutions will then be aggregated using a consensus agent that weighs their contributions based on predefined criteria, such as confidence and relevance.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a set of agents with different roles (e.g., domain-specific, general, cross-linguistic).\n2. Each agent independently solves the problem, focusing on its assigned aspect.\n3. Collect and aggregate the insights using a consensus agent.\n4. Integrate expert feedback iteratively to refine the final answer.\n5. Ensure the solution converges or improves meaningfully at each iteration.",

This approach ensures that the final solution is comprehensive and robust by considering the contributions of multiple specialized agents. The integration of expert feedback further refines the solution, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement an ensemble architecture where multiple specialized agents independently solve the problem. Each agent focuses on different aspects such as algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and different languages. The solutions from these agents will be aggregated through a dynamic weighted voting mechanism based on trust scores. Expert feedback will be integrated iteratively to refine the final answer.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a set of specialized agents, each focusing on a different aspect or language.\n2. Each agent independently solves the problem.\n3. Aggregate the solutions using a dynamic weighted voting mechanism where the weights are based on the trust scores of each agent.\n4. Integrate expert feedback iteratively to refine the final answer.\n5. Ensure the solution converges or improves meaningfully at each iteration.",

This approach involves multiple agents working collaboratively on different aspects of the problem, regularly assessing each other's progress, and providing real-time feedback to refine their solutions. This mimics a human collaborative environment where peers constantly review and improve each other's work.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement a 'Collaborative Problem Solving with Real-Time Peer Assessments' architecture. This will involve multiple agents working on different aspects of the problem, providing regular assessments, and iteratively refining their solutions based on peer feedback.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize specialized agents for different problem-solving aspects.\n2. Each agent independently solves the problem in the first round.\n3. Collect peer feedback on each agent's solution.\n4. Adjust strategies based on peer feedback and iteratively refine solutions.\n5. Aggregate final solutions and refine them using expert feedback.",

However, it can be made more dynamic and continuous in its feedback application and strategy adjustment.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nRefine the 'Dynamic Real-Time Strategy Adjustment' by integrating continuous real-time feedback into the strategy adjustment steps. This ensures that feedback is applied dynamically and continuously throughout the problem-solving process, leading to a more refined and accurate solution.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize specialized agents with different problem-solving strategies.\n2. Each agent solves the problem, dynamically adjusting their strategies based on continuous real-time feedback.\n3. Aggregate the intermediate solutions and expert feedback to form the final answer.\n4. Ensure the solution converges or improves meaningfully at each iteration.",

This approach ensures continuous refinement and robust problem-solving strategies, making it an interesting and potentially more effective solution.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe revised architecture will focus on refining the hierarchical decomposition approach by integrating continuous evaluation and feedback at every level of the hierarchy. This means that each subproblem will be solved by specialized agents, and their solutions will be evaluated and refined continuously before being aggregated into the final solution. The feedback will come from experts, peers, and self-evaluation, creating a robust and dynamic problem-solving loop.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Decompose the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem using specialized agents.\n4. Collect continuous feedback on each secondary subproblem\u2019s solution and refine them iteratively.\n5. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback.\n6. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution.\n7. Continuously integrate expert feedback to refine the final answer.",

This will involve having each agent solve the problem independently, then proposing their solutions for peer evaluation. Peers will vote on the best solution, which will be refined iteratively based on continuous feedback.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nThe 'Collaborative Voting with Dynamic Feedback' architecture will have role-specific agents solving the problem independently. Each solution will be evaluated by peers, and a voting mechanism will be used to select the best solution. This solution will be refined iteratively based on continuous feedback from peers and experts.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Initialize a set of role-specific agents to solve the problem independently.\n2. Each agent proposes a solution, which is evaluated by peers.\n3. Implement a voting mechanism to select the best solution based on peer evaluations.\n4. Refine the selected solution iteratively based on continuous feedback from peers and experts.\n5.

The hierarchical structure will help break down the problem into manageable subproblems, while the competitive and collaborative elements will ensure continuous refinement and robustness.\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement a 'Hierarchical Collaborative Refinement' architecture. This involves breaking the problem into primary subproblems, further decomposing them into secondary subproblems, solving each subproblem competitively, and then refining them collaboratively based on expert feedback. This process will iteratively refine solutions to ensure they converge or improve meaningfully.\n**Implementation:**\n1. Decompose the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem using specialized agents with competitive refinement.\n4. Collect continuous feedback on each secondary subproblem's solution and refine them iteratively.\n5. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback.\n6. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution.\n7.

This will involve a more structured approach to storing and utilizing meta-learning insights, ensuring continuous and granular feedback loops at every level of the hierarchy. The goal is to dynamically adjust problem-solving strategies based on accumulated feedback and ensure robust and effective solutions.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement 'Adaptive Meta-Learning with Hierarchical Decomposition' by focusing on systematic integration of meta-learning insights and continuous feedback loops. The architecture will break down the main problem into primary and secondary subproblems, solve each subproblem using specialized agents, and dynamically adjust strategies based on feedback. The feedback will come from peers and experts and will be used to iteratively refine the solutions.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Primary Task Decomposer Agent to break down the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems using a Secondary Task Decomposer Agent.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem using specialized agents, incorporating dynamic strategy adjustment based on accumulated meta-learning insights.\n4. Collect continuous feedback on each secondary subproblem's solution and refine them iteratively.\n5. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback.\n6. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution.\n7. Continuously integrate expert feedback to refine the final answer.",

This approach ensures that agents' strategies are continuously improved through feedback and reward mechanisms.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nImplement 'Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Hierarchical Decomposition' by explicitly defining RL components such as reward functions and learning mechanisms. The architecture will break down the main problem into primary and secondary subproblems, solve each subproblem using RL-enhanced agents, and dynamically adjust strategies based on reward feedback. This approach ensures continuous optimization of agent strategies.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Primary Task Decomposer Agent to break down the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems using a Secondary Task Decomposer Agent.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem using RL-enhanced agents, incorporating dynamic strategy adjustment based on accumulated reward feedback.\n4. Collect continuous feedback on each secondary subproblem's solution and refine them iteratively.\n5. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback.\n6. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution.\n7. Continuously integrate expert feedback to refine the final answer.",

By refining these components and ensuring they are effectively integrated, the architecture can significantly improve problem-solving strategies.\n\n**Overall Idea:**\nEnhance 'Evolutionary Algorithm-Enhanced Hierarchical Decomposition' by refining the implementation of evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, and mutation) and optimizing the reward mechanism. This involves breaking down the main problem into primary and secondary subproblems, solving each subproblem using enhanced evolutionary operations, and dynamically adjusting strategies based on reward feedback. This approach ensures continuous optimization of agent strategies.\n\n**Implementation:**\n1. Use a Primary Task Decomposer Agent to break down the main problem into primary subproblems.\n2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems using a Secondary Task Decomposer Agent.\n3. Solve each secondary subproblem using enhanced evolutionary operations (selection, crossover, and mutation) and RL principles.\n4. Collect continuous feedback on each secondary subproblem's solution and refine them iteratively.\n5. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback.\n6. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution.\n7. Continuously integrate expert feedback to refine the final answer.",

However, the feedback loop needs to be more structured and explicitly defined to ensure that visual insights are effectively utilized during the aggregation of solutions. **Overall Idea:** Refine the 'Multimodal Hierarchical Decomposition with Continuous Feedback' by explicitly defining how visual feedback will be integrated at each level of decomposition and ensuring that the feedback loop is robust and structured. The goal is to maximize the synergy between textual and visual information to enhance problem-solving accuracy. **Implementation:** 1. Decompose the main problem into primary subproblems using a Primary Task Decomposer Agent. 2. Further decompose each primary subproblem into secondary subproblems using a Secondary Task Decomposer Agent. 3. Generate visual representations for each secondary subproblem. 4. Solve each secondary subproblem using both textual and visual information. 5. Collect feedback on solutions and refine them iteratively using both textual and visual insights. 6. Aggregate secondary subproblem solutions into primary subproblem solutions and refine them based on continuous feedback. 7. Aggregate primary subproblem solutions into the final solution. 8. Continuously integrate expert feedback to refine the final answer.",
